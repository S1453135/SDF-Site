<h2>Welcome to the farm!</h2>
<p>Storm Dancer Farm sits near Smithville Lake, just north of Kansas City MO.  We raise pasture-based beef and dairy and meat goats -
	 and hopefully poultry again soon!.
	Our animals are given as much opportunity as we can offer to graze or browse, with hay and some grain supplemented.</p>
<p>We are an affiliate of Goats On The Go&reg; and operate in the greater KC area as Goats On The Go - Kansas City North&amp;.
	Let us know if you're interested in having our crew of hungry goats come graze your troublesome weeds!</p>
<p>We welcome visitors to the farm to meet the animals.  We travel too - we're more than happy to bring some four-legged friends 
	if you would like a "meet and greet", educational event, or some goat yoga!</p>
